# To-do React App

This is a simple yet customizable Todo application built with React. It allows you to create, manage, and track your tasks efficiently.

## Features

In the project directory, these are the features of the application: \
    - Add new tasks \
    - Mark tasks as complete \
    - View a list of all tasks (completed and incomplete) \
    - Clear completed tasks

## Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure you have the following installed: \
    - Node.js \
    - NPM or YARN

This is required for development in React.

## Clone Repository

In order to start the project, the repository has to be cloned.

    - git clone <https://github.com/your-username/to-do-list-app.git>
    
    - cd to-do-list-app

## Installation of Dependencies

    - npm install

    # OR

    yarn install

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can't go back!**

If you aren't satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you're on your own.

You don't have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn't feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn't be useful if you couldn't customize it when you are ready for it.
