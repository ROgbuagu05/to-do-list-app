# To-do React App

This is a simple yet customizable Todo application built with React. It allows you to create, manage, and track your tasks efficiently.

## Features

In the project, these are the features of the application: \
    - Add new tasks \
    - Mark tasks as complete \
    - View a list of all tasks (completed and incomplete) \
    - Clear completed tasks

## Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure you have the following installed: \
    - Node.js \
    - NPM or YARN

This is required for development in React.

## Usage

The app is straightforward. You can add new tasks by entering them in the input field and clicking the "Add Task" button. Existing tasks will be displayed in a list. Clicking on a task will mark it as complete, and a strikethrough will be applied to the text. Tasks can be deleted when all has been completed.
